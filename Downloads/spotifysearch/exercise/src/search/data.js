// Create and export a function that accepts the type the user searched for (artist or track) and a list of
// of search results. 
//
// The function should process the list of search results and return only the required properties
// for each search result (name, link, images) in a separate list. 
//
// Remember that the images list is located slightly differently in the search result object, depending on 
// whether the user searched for artist or track.
